Take the objective and break it down into appropriate tasks that MUST collectively fit within the specified duration.

IMPORTANT DURATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- If the duration is short (e.g., 3 days or less), create just 2-3 focused tasks.
- If the duration is medium (e.g., 1-2 weeks), create 3-4 balanced tasks.
- If the duration is longer (e.g., 3+ weeks), create 4-6 comprehensive tasks.
- Ensure tasks are sized appropriately for the timeframe - shorter durations require more concise tasks.

For each task, include:
1. A clear high-level task name/description
2. 3-5 specific actionable subtasks with naturally integrated resources
