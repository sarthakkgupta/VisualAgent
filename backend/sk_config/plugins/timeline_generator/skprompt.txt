Provide a simple time duration estimate for completing this task.

IMPORTANT TIMELINE CONSTRAINTS:
- Your duration MUST respect the overall plan duration
- Express durations in days rather than weeks whenever possible
- Ensure your estimate allows ALL tasks to fit within the total timeframe
- If this task is part of a short total duration (e.g., 3 days), keep the estimate very concise (1-2 days)

Task: {{$input}}

Just return a clear and concise duration estimate like "1 day", "3 days", "5 days", etc. 
ONLY use weeks as the unit if the task genuinely requires more than 10 days.
No additional explanation needed.
